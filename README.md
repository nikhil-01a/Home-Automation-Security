# Home-Automation-Security
Completed an internship at Li2 Technologies, where I worked on Home Automation and Security Systems. To control home appliances with the help of Google Assistant, I used an IOT based microcontroller NodeMCU (ESP8266) and connected it with the components using a relay, I used IFTTT android application and Adafruit IO to apply the logic. I used Google Assistant to operate these appliances with my voice requests. The project's second phase dealt with security systems. It was completed in the field of Digital Image Processing, where I worked on real-time face recognition using the Raspberry Pi and OpenCV software. In this project, I used the Haar cascade method, which proved to be highly effective when used with a Raspberry Pi board to detect any person or object. On the Raspberry Pi, I coded and ran scripts using the Python programming language. As a result, the final product could detect any person and then recognize the faces of people whose photos we had collected in our database.
